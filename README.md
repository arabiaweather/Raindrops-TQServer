TQServer - ALPHA
========

Transactional Queue Server Built with NodeJS

The main usecase TQServer taks into consideration is high content integration and also mantaining fast processing of requests.
By both utilizing the non-Blocking I/O of Nodejs and the Async methods TQServer makes sure to push data fast, serve it fast 
And still give the client the Transactionl Data Integrity methods to either commit a Pop or Rollit back. 

TQServer is very easy to setup and use and does not require hard work to get it up and running, it also has a very small 
footprint to keep it fast, and not to take up alot of server resources.
